<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hashing
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
we want to create these functions : 

get : to get the value fot spicific key  
set : add new pucket that contains (key :value)
hash : function that calculate  hash code
contains : check if the tacle contans spicifice key or not 

## Approach & Efficiency
 What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? 
get : approach ==> (if statement ) time /space BigO(1)
set :approach ==> (if statement )  time  BigO(1) /space BigO(n)
hash :  time /space BigO(1)
contains : approach ==> (if statement / loop   )  time  /space BigO(n)
