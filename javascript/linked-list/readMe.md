# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
-how to create linked list 
-how to add node 
-how to create pointers 
-how to loop through linked list nodes
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
i created a linked list class with function (Insert , append , includes, toString )
insert ===> add node to start of linked list
append ===> add node to end of linked list
includes ===> check if value exists in the linked list or not 
toString ===> return all values of the nodes in the linked list 

## Approach & Efficiency
 What approach did you take?  while loop && if statments 
  Why? to loop through linked list nodes and check for the condition  
  What is the Big O space/time for this approach? Big O(n)  

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert ===> add node to start of linked list
append ===> add node to end of linked list
includes ===> check if value exists in the linked list or not 
toString ===> return all values of the nodes in the linked list
